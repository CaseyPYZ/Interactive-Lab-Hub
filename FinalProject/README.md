Big Idea:
Our Final Project device is a distributed handshake system that is meant to facilitate communication and connections between two users who are physically located in separate locations. The device includes two co-located robotic hands which move and operate on servo motors connected to the wrist joint and fingers. The two hands would move in a handshake motion on inputs from the users. If the users time sending the handshake signal well and the two hands successfully make contact, a contact sensor sends a positive feedback signal to the users.


Timeline:
Nov 18th – Talk about ideas and submit Project Plan 
Nov 19th – 26th – Iterate on project plan and create hardware setups through cardboard or 3D printing
Nov 27th – Dec 4th   – Write software portion of the project and correct hardware bugs
Dec 5th - Dec 7th – Video Editing and make project presentation
Dec 8th – Dec 12th – Write up and Documentation
Dec 13th – Contingency day for emergencies
Dec 14th - Copious amounts of alcohol consumption to rehabilitate the team’s mental health


Parts Needed:
•	3d printed or cardboard hands
•	10x servo motors
•	Fishing wire or taut string
•	Copper contact material
•	Contact sensor


Risks/Contingencies:
3d printing being too complicated
Contact sensors not working as intended
Build falls apart due to weight and structural issues


Fall Back Plan:
Simpler version: high five machine
